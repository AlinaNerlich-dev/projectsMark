# Project 3

## Questions for a code review:

### 1. FILTER FUNCTION

#### How could I have written the function using filter()? I was able to console log the correct data, but I dont know how to modif now the according CSS with this. I kept it in line 55 incl. a console.log()

### 2. RENDERING IN MAIN

#### Why do I have to use main.innerHTML = renderExperiences and not +=? In all your videos you are using += but here its not working?!

### 3. SOLUTION OUTERHTML

#### Is this a proper way to solve the assignment?

### 4. Project VIEWS

#### Could you show me here how I can create generateProjectWrapper with a function? This you have also done in one video and again I cant make it work.. Now it shows null instead of the Object. I really want to understand this whole topic before starting with React

# Thank you so much
