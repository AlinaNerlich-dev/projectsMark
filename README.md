# Project 3

## Questions for a code review:

## Project3

### 4. Project VIEWS

#### Could you show me here how I can create generateProjectWrapper with a function? This you have also done in one video and again I cant make it work.. Now it shows null instead of the Object. I really want to understand this whole topic before starting with React

##### **Answer**: I would start by copying over (yes, copy and paste), the solutions you have for a similar task in experience.js, and then modify the function names and other relevant info. Unless I'm misunderstanding the question? Please let me know if I am.

#### **Dame question** Comig back to question 4: I meant within the project view is still a mistake, when I do it like yu show in the video. I get a 'null' before the projects are rendered and I think it is becuse of my generateProjectWrapper Function?

## react-router-dom

### 5. ALl my Questions are wihin the Form.jsx. and Hero.jsx.

# Thank you so much
